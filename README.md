cat <br />
apple <br />
apricot <br />
fish

Return the list: <br />

d <br />
c <br />
app <br />
apr <br />
f <br />

<h3>Problem 34 - Jane Street</h3>

Given an arithmetic expression in Reverse Polish Notation, write a program to evaluate it.

The expression is given as a list of numbers and operands. For example: [5, 3, '+'] should return 5 + 3 = 8.

For example, [15, 7, 1, 1, '+', '-', '/', 3, '*', 2, 1, 1, '+', '+', '-'] should return 5, since it is equivalent to ((15 / (7 - (1 + 1))) \* 3) - (2 + (1 + 1)) = 5.

You can assume the given expression is always valid.

<h3>Problem 121 - MongoDB</h3>

Given a list of elements, find the majority element, which appears more than half the time (> floor(len(lst) / 2.0)). You can assume that such element exists.

For example, given [1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 4, 0], return 1.

<h3>Problem 122 - Facebook</h3>

Given a positive integer n, find the smallest number of squared integers which sum to n.

For example, given n = 13, return 2 since 13 = 32 + 22 = 9 + 4. Given n = 27, return 3 since 27 = 32 + 32 + 32 = 9 + 9 + 9.

<h3>Problem 123 - Amazon</h3>

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, carrace should return true, since it can be rearranged to form racecar, which is a palindrome. daily should return false since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

<h3>Problem 124 - Slack</h3>

You are given an N by M matrix of 0s and 1s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner You can only move right and down. 0 represents an empty space while 1 represents a wall you cannot walk through.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[0, 0, 1],<br/>
[0, 0, 1],<br/>
[1, 0, 0]]

Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:<br/>
Right, down, down, right<br/>
Down, right, down, right<br/>

The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be 0.

<h3>Problem 125 - Google</h3>

Given a string, return the first recurring character in it, or null if there is no recurring character.

For example, given the string "acbbac", return "b". Given the string "abcdef", return null.

<h3>Problem 126 - Uber</h3>

Given a tree where each edge has a weight, compute the length of the longest path in the tree.

The path does not have to pass through the root, and each node can have any amount of children.

<h3>Problem 127 - Facebook</h3>

Given a 32-bit integer, return the number with its bits reversed.

For example, given the binary number 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000, return 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0000 1111.

<h3>Problem 128 - Google</h3>

You are given an array of length n + 1 whose elements belong to the set {1, 2, ..., n}. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a duplicate. Find it in linear time and space.
