<h3>Problem 124 - Company: Slack</h3>

You are given an N by M matrix of 0s and 1s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner You can only move right and down. 0 represents an empty space while 1 represents a wall you cannot walk through.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[0, 0, 1],<br/>
[0, 0, 1],<br/>
[1, 0, 0]]

Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:<br/>
Right, down, down, right<br/>
Down, right, down, right<br/>

The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be 0.
