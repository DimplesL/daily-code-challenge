/**

 * A competitive runner would like to create a route that starts and ends at his house, with the condition
 * that the route goes entirely uphill at first, and then entirely downhill.
 *
 * Given a dictionary of places of the form {location: elevation}, and a dictionary mapping paths between
 * some of these locations to their corresponding distances, find the length of the shortest route satisfying
 * the condition above. Assume the runner's home is location 0.
