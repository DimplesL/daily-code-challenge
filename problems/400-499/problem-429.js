 * Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of integers constructed with the following formula:
 *
 * The first row consists of the number 1.
 * For each subsequent row, each element is the sum of the numbers directly above it, on either side.
 *
 * Given an input k, return the kth row of Pascal's triangle.
 * Bonus: Can you do this using only O(k) space?
