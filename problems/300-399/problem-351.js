 * Word sense disambiguation is the problem of determining which sense a word takes on in a particular setting, if that word has multiple meanings.
 * For example, in the sentence "I went to get money from the bank", bank probably means the place where people deposit money, not the land beside
 * a river or lake.
 *
 * Given a sentence, most of whose words are contained in the meaning list above, create an algorithm that determines the likely sense of each possibly
 * ambiguous word.
