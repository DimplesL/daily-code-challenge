 * The edit distance between two strings refers to the minimum number of character
 * insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to change one string to the
 * other. For example, the edit distance between “kitten” and “sitting” is three:
 * substitute the “k” for “s”, substitute the “e” for “i”, and append a “g”.
 * Given two strings, compute the edit distance between them.
